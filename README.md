# BattleShip
C++ object-oriented implementation of BattleShip

Simple code for BattleShip game where two Players place their ships across a 2-D grid each, and then guess 
their opponent's ship coordinates. The game ends when all the ships of one player are sunk. The code will be 
updated soon, with a smart player that's gonna take into account real-world, logic parameters, giving him
the ability to win easier and faster.
